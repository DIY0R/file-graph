**file-graph** is a library for working with graphs that uses a file-based storage system to save data. It provides functionality for creating, updating, deleting, and searching for graph vertices and edges, as well as for performing traversal and pathfinding operations in the graph.

Before starting with **file-graph**, make sure you have the following components installed:

- Node.js (recommended version 18 or higher)
- A package manager like npm or yarn
